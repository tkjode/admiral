# Some things to work on

- What's the difference between Feature and Library again?
- [ ] Make the Certs library/feature generic enough to re-use leveraging Values.yaml
- [ ] Need to figure out how to supply a Patcher manifest (maybe a Job that oc applies a patch) to update the apiserver to a new cert
- [x] Keycloak needs a database for persistence and a KeycloakRealmImport to auto-setup ~~UnderdarkAuthServices~~ PhalNet Realm.
- [ ] Finalize applications/library folder structures for the bootstrapper ArgoCD App
- [ ] Visualize the SyncWaves to boot a cluster up

## Operator General

- [ ] Feature that installs OLM on base k8s clusters

## Secrets Stack

- [ ] External Secrets Operator installation
- [ ] ESO Config:
  - [ ] Cluster Vault Config

## Cert Stack

- [ ] cert-manager operator installation
- [ ] LetsEncrypt ACME configurizer (should include staging & prod as values instances)
  - [ ] ExternalSecrets should be used to house the AWS Route53 role data here

## Auth Stack

- CrunchyData Operator Installation & Instancing
- KeyCloak Operator Installation & Instancing
- KeyCloak RealmImport Data (Realm: phalnet)
  - Can the role mappings stuff be included in the import?  This allows Keycloak roles to auto-create Groups
  - https://blog.badgerops.net/keycloak-open-shift/   simple guide on doing it manually
- OAuth/cluster refinement - Syncwave Update post Keycloak install
  - Add Identity Provider to the cluster
  - How to get clientSecret sync'd over?  The key/value is not an object, it's in Postgres :/
