# Some things to work on

- [ ] Make the Certs library/feature generic enough to re-use leveraging Values.yaml
- [ ] Need to figure out how to supply a Patcher manifest (maybe a Job that oc applies a patch) to update the apiserver to a new cert
- [ ] Keycloak needs a database for persistence and a KeycloakRealmImport to auto-setup UnderdarkAuthServices Realm.
- [ ] Finalize applications/library folder structures for the bootstrapper ArgoCD App
- [ ] Visualize the SyncWaves to boot a cluster up
