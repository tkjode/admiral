# OpenTofu

## Intro

OpenTofu will be used to deploy infrastructure using various virtualization and/or cloud providers.

This folder should contain folders for generics (eg modules) and possibly specific environments.

## Lab Environment

HomeLab will ideally try to use:

- Proxmox/QEMU as the virtualization provider
- Talos OS as the Kubernetes-specific immutable VM image
